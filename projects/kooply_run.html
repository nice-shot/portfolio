                Kooply is a mobile gaming startup that specializes on games with built-in editors that allow players to
                create and share their own levels. Kooply Run is the company's flagship app. It's a 3D runner game in
                the vein of Subway Surfers and Sonic Dash and it allows players to create unique levels on their phones
                using a very powerful editor.
